# Audio Recorder Web App

## Overview

This web application allows users to record audio directly in the frontend and send it to the backend for processing. The backend is built using Node.js, and Multer is used to handle file uploads.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (Node Package Manager): Included with Node.js installation

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

   Make sure to replace `server.js` with the actual filename of your Node.js server file.

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

3. Use the audio recorder functionality on the frontend to record audio.

4. Submit the recorded audio, and it will be processed by the backend.

## Dependencies

- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer): Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, used for file uploads.
